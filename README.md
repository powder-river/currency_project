#Currency Project: Week 1
------------------------------------------------
##Purpose
The purpose of this project was to be able to convert a value in one currency to another currency. So if I have 5 American dollars, this program will tell me how many euros that would equal. This program accepts USD (American Dollars), EUR (European Euros), and ILS
(Israeli Sheckel, side note: studied abroad in Israel, great country)


##Process
I approached this process as always by starting with something simple that I can get to work. In this case I just started with 1 class and worked on one task at a time. That kept me from getting too confused and kept me moving in a positive direction.

After I completed 1 class I moved on to the next and took the same approach.

##Problems
The two biggest problems during this project ended up being:

1. Interpreting instructions/ Understanding what the final project would look like.

2. "Following the Bread Crumbs" of how the classes interacted with each other and the main file. I named something "code" in both classes and I think it threw me off. Would like to discuss this further.

##Conclusion
This is a working program that functions as I intend. The project started off at a 5 as far as difficulty goes and dropped down to a 4 after you held that review session on Thursday. That cleared much up.
